    \section{Introduction}

    \begin{itemize}
        \item Time course of pS6K in AA and AA + rapamycin conditions \cite{patursky-polischuk2014}
        \item Rheb activates AMPK and reduces p27 in TSC2 null cells which in turn reduces cdk2 \cite{lacher2010rheb}
        \item Rheb is constitutively active in TSC2 knockout cells \cite{lacher2010rheb}
        \item In TSC2 null cells, down regulating Rheb down regulated mTORC1 and s6k
        \item TSC2 is a GAP for Rheb~\cite{inoki2003}
        \item The more TSC2 in the system the more Rheb that is hydrolysed \cite{inoki2003}
        \item Rheb-GTP is an activator of mTORC1, measured by an increase in S6K and 4EBP phos
        \item The more RhebGTP present the more mTORC1 activation and S6K/4EBP phos \cite{inoki2003}
    \end{itemize}

    \subsection{\cite{Sarbassov2005phosphorylation}}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item mTORC1 phosphorylates Akt at S473
    \end{itemize}

    This is a review
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Amino acids inhibit TSC2
    \end{itemize}

    \subsection{\cite{hinalt2004amino}}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Insulin and amino acids both stimulate mTORC1 individually and synergize together
        \item Wortmannin inhibits these reactions
    \end{itemize}

    \subsection{\cite{hardie2012ampk}}
    AMPK and energy review
    \begin{itemize}
        \item During muscle contraction, glucose is used to generate ATP. AMPK enhances this process
        \item Muscle glucose uptake is also promoted by insulin, when the fate of glucose is storage as glycogen
        \item GLUT4 mediates the glucose update in both of these situations
        \item GLUT4 are glucose transporters that reside in vesicles near the plasma membrane
        \item GLUT4 containing vesicles need to fuse with the plasma membrane to allow them to transport glucose
        \item This fusion requiers RAB G proteins in their GTP bound state, though RAB G proteins are basally exist in their GDP bound state
        \item RAB G proteins are held in an inactive GDP bound state by RAB-GAP proteins, one of which is called Akt substrate 160 (AS160 / TBC1D4) and TBC1D1, both of which are associated with the GLUT4 containing vesicles
        \item Akt phos AS160 in muscle and adipocytes allowing it to associate with 14-3-3 proteins which leads to disociation from the vesicles
        \item AMPK also phosphorylates TBC1D1 in contracting muscle, also recruits 14-3-3 prroteins and leading to dissociation from vesicles
        \item In both biological contexts, the Rab-GAP dissociation results in the loading of Rab with GTP and fusion of GLUT4 containing vesicles with the membrane
        \item .
    \end{itemize}

    \subsection{\cite{hains2019greb1}}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item GREB1 gene response to E2 treatment via the estrogen receptor
        \item GREB1 is required for hormone dependent proliferation
        \item knock down of GREB1 results in growth arrent
        \item overexpression of GREB1 results in oncogenic senescence
        \item GREB1 regulates PI3K/Akt/mTORC1
        \item Growth arrested BC cells from GREB1 knock down can be rescued by constitutive Akt activation
    \end{itemize}

    \subsection{\cite{miller2010hyperactivity}}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item A mechanism of resistance to endocrine therapies is overexpression of HER2
        \item but only a small portion (around 10\%)
    \end{itemize}

    \subsection{\cite{miller2010hyperactivity}}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item These guys generated 4 long term estrogen deprevation BC cell lines (LTED)
        \item Depriving these cells of estrogen is associated with hyperactivation of IGF/Insulin and EGF signalling
        \item

    \subsection{\cite{liu2018targeting}}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item JakStat, Ras-PKC, NFkB and Kit signalling pathways regulate IDO1
        \item Downstream of IDO1, GCN2 is activated, mTORC1 is inhibited by Tryp deprevation and the aryl hydrocarbon receptor pathway (AhR) is activated, since Kyn is ligand for the receptor
        \item IDO1 is not expressed in most tissues under physiological conditions but constitutively expressed in many types of cancer
        \item IDO1 is activated by diverse inflammatory signals: TNFa, TGFb, PAMPS, DAMPs, PGE2, via nfkb and jak stat pathways
        \item constitutive IDO1 expression is mediated by cyclooxygenase and PGE2 via PKC and PI3K pathways \cite{hennequart2017constitutive}
        \item IDO1 is under the regulation of of Bin1. Bin1 KO results in tumour growth and immune supression via upregulation of Stat1 and nfkb dependent \cite{muller2005inhibition}
        \item Ras regulates IDO1 in cancer
        \item
        \item The depletion of Trp by IDO1 leads to accumulation of uncharged Trp-tRNA, which binds to and activates GCN2 a stress response kinase
        \item GCN2 phos and inhibits eukaryotic initiation factor 2 alpha, attenuating transcription and translation
        \item mTOR is also inhibited by Trp deprevation leading to activation of autophagy (via AMPK?)
        \item Both GCN2 and mTOR effectors of IDO1 are immunesuppressive
        \item AhR is a cytosolic ligand-activated TF. Its most potant ligand is TCDD which upregulates IDO1 expression \cite{vogel2008aryl}. Therefore it might be the case that Kyn binding to AhR also upregulates IDO1.
        \item Since Kyn is also a ligand for AhR, we have a positive feedback \cite{opitz2011endogenous}
        \item AhR is bHLH family
        \item Kyn leads to the translocation of AhR into the nucleus after 1h \cite{opitz2011endogenous}
        \item In the nucleus, the AhR forms a heterodimer with ARNT that interacts with dioxin response elements (DRE) \cite{opitz2011endogenous}
        \item

    %		\item Figure 1B
    %		\item S6K response to AA with mild phos but not to insulin. When combined, S6K has much larger phos response.
    %		\item Akt S473 is phos basally with no change with addition of AA. Insulin causes massive phos of Akt but both AA and insulin together produce a weaker signal.
    %		\item TSC2 is not phos by AA stim but is by insulin or both. Looks like AA provides no potentiation to the insulin signal.

    \subsection{\cite{demetriades2014regulation}}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item RAG proteins bind TSC2.
        \item Therefore, RAGs not only activate mTORC1 by inducing their recruitment to the lysosome under AA stimulation, they also actively actively repress mTORC1 in the absence of AA
        \item binding between rag proteins and TSC2 increases upon AA removal
        \item TSC2 is recruited to lysome in a Rag dependent manner when AAs are removed
        \item \begin{itemize}
                  \item TSC is cytoplasmic when AA present
                  \item On removal TSC2 quickly accumulates on lysosomal surface (15 min)
                  \item impaired Rag protein integrity blunts lysosomal accumulation of TSC2 upon AA removal and reduced mtorc activation on AA readdition
        \end{itemize}
        \item TSC2 is required for complete inactivation of mTORC1 when AAs are removed
        \item \begin{itemize}
                  \item cells lacking TSC2are unable to completly inactivate mtor on AA removal
                  \item
                  \item
